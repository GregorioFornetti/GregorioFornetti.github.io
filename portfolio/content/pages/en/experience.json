My first experience with academic research was as an undergraduate researcher initially funded by CNPQ and then by FAPESP. During the undergraduate research, I became a member of the LaSID RecSys group. I generated embeddings using the RecVae model, used in our weighted similarities method. I implemented some optimized MAB algorithms for recommender systems, which were used in many papers for the group. These modifications originated the GOBRec library. I also elaborated and implemented the experimental protocols for evaluating incremental recommender systems, deciding how the code should be organized, and documenting all the repositories used in our papers. I wrote some sections of the published papers, contributing to the review process. I also led the development of many video games in the Maritacas Gamedev group. For a period, I was one of the coordinators of this entity, orienting beginner students as they developed their first games."
