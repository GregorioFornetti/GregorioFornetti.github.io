    "about_text": "The LaSID RecSys group is part of the [Intelligent Systems and Data Science Laboratory (LaSID)](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/) at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). The main focus of the group is researching Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods applied to Recommender Systems (RecSys), particularly Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms, and exploring how to utilize time/date information to enhance recommendations.",
    "contributions_text": "I was a member of the [LaSID RecSys group](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/). It was my first experience with academic research, conducting an undergraduate research project initially funded by CNP and later by FAPESP. When I started my Master's degree, I remained in the group as a volunteer researcher. During this period, I generated embeddings using the RecVae model, used in our weighted similarities method. I implemented some optimized MAB algorithms for recommender systems, which were used in many papers for the group. These modifications originated the [GOBRec library](https://github.com/UFSCar-LaSID/gobrec). I also elaborated and implemented the experimental protocols for evaluating incremental recommender systems, deciding how the code should be organized, and documenting all the repositories used in our papers. Finally, I wrote some sections of the published papers, contributing to the review process."
