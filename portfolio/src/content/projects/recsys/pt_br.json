    "about_text": "The LaSID RecSys group is part of the Intelligent Systems Laboratory (LaSID) at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). The main focus of the group is researching reinforcement learning methods applied to recommender systems, particularly multi-armed bandit algorithms, and exploring how to utilize time/date information to enhance recommendations.",
    "contributions_text": "I was a member of the LaSID RecSys group. It was my first contact with  academic research, doing undergraduate research initially funded by CNPQ and then by FAPESP. When I started my Master's degree, I stayed in the group as a volunteer researcher. During this period, I helped to generate embeddings with the RecVae model, which was further used in our weighted sims method. I implemented some optimized MAB algorithms for recommender systems, which were used in many experiments, generating some important papers for the group. These modifications originated the GOBRec library. I also helped in the elaboration and implementation of experimental protocols for evaluating incremental recommender systems, deciding how the code should be organized, and documenting all the repositories used in our papers. Finally, I wrote some sections of the published papers, also helping in the process of the review."
