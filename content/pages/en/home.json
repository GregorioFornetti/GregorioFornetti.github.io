    "summary": "I'm Greg, a Master's (MSc) student in the [Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar)](https://www.ufscar.br/), exchange student at [Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI)](https://www.thi.de/), and member of the [Intelligent Systems and Data Science Laboratory (LaSID)](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/). Currently, my research focus is on computer vision, applying 3D object detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction for traffic safety, in the context of the [Conecta 2030 project](https://aware.thi.de/en/sobre-aware/press-releases/detail-news/news/projekt-conecta-2030-mehr-strassensicherheit-mit-spitzentechnologie/). In the same context, my MSc research proposes a new point cloud background filtering method that could bring accuracy and efficiency improvements in 3D object detection models. I also contribute to the LaSID RecSys group, where I implement and research incremental recommender systems. I received my Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science from UFSCar, and during this period, I focused my studies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), conducting funded undergraduate research in these areas.",
