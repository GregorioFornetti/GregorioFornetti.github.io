    "about_text": "[Conecta2030](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/conecta-2030/) is a project that utilizes 5G, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), digital twins, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect high-risk situations involving vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. The project has multidisciplinary teams from different universities: Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), São Paulo University (USP), Institute of Research of Centro Universitário Facens (IP FACENS), and Germany's Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI). The project also received collaborations from TIM Brasil and Stellantis. Worth highlighting that this project was approved in the [Rota 2030 Program](https://mover.fundep.ufmg.br/home/).",
    "contributions_text": "As a member of the AI team, I mainly developed 3D perception models. I trained SECOND and BEVFusion detection models in simulated and real infrastructure (roadside) view datasets. I implemented a 3D tracking and trajectory prediction model, creating a framework that detects, tracks, and predicts trajectories, which was used in the final project infrastructure. I also modified the simulated DOLPHINS dataset for our scenario, adding new VRUs (cyclists and motorcyclists) and unique identifiers for each object, which were used for tracking and trajectory evaluation. Finally, I generated high-risk simulated scenarios in CARLA to evaluate our models with different LiDAR sensors."
